## **Directions for Initial WiProsper Transfer:**

Directions:

1.  Head to website <https://github.com/AryaJ3365/Investment-Prediction-Application/tree/main> if you haven't already.
2.  Request for application access from johnsaaa@mail.uc.edu for google colab code access.
3.  Download WiProsper venture dataset and start adding venture data as the company progresses. Reminder: Keep this dataset private as this is WiProsper private data.
4.  Then there you have it, until you receive at least 25 ventures continue using my initial dataset, which will already be linked and chosen within the Google Colab application.

## **Adding the WiProsper Dataset instead of the initial venture dataset:**

Directions:

1.  First make sure you have requested at least 25 different ventures with KPIs for the WiProsper dataset before proceeding to this step.
2.  Next make a private repository to store this dataset in since this dataset does not contain any public information.
3.  Finally head to google colab venture model and comment out the original df line with a \# and instead input the link of your new df.
    1.  To get the link to put in from the GitHub repository simply click on your dataset and show the raw code. Then copy the link that shows up when you are viewing the raw code of your dataset.

1.  Finally go ahead and run the google colab program and if the dataset has no issues you should now be allow to make predictions strictly using only the WiProsper dataset.
